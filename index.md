### **Key Adjustments:**
1. **Centered Text**:
   - All content is wrapped within `<div style="text-align: center;">` to center-align everything globally.
   - Lists are further centered within an inline-block container to maintain their indentation (`text-align: left; display: inline-block;`).

2. **Consistent Styling**:
   - Lists and content are neatly aligned for readability.
   - Margins ensure the lists donâ€™t stretch beyond their natural bounds when centered.

3. **Inline CSS**:
   - Used inline styles to avoid reliance on external CSS files, ensuring compatibility with GitHub Pages' Minimal theme.

### **Result**
All text and lists will appear centered, with proper alignment for bullets and content. Let me know if further refinements are needed!
