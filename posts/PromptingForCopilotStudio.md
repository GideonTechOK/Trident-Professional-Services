Clearly identify what you want to achieve.

### Be Specific and Clear

Articulate your request precisely.

- **Ineffective Prompt**: "Get the numbers from the report."

### Use Relevant Keywords

Incorporate keywords that align with your objective.

### Provide Context

Offer additional information to narrow down the search.

- **With Context**: "From the 'Financial Overview' section, list all expenses over \$10,000."
